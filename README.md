# Craft a Hash Table from scratch

**Where data finds its bucket.**

## What is this?

Think of this project as a tiny library where stuff knows exactly where to sit. You toss something in, and it magically lands in the right spot every time. No wandering around, no “have you seen my keys?”, no existential crisis in aisle three. Just tidy, instant organization.

## Why does it exist?

Because order is better than chaos, and curiosity is better than ignorance. This is a small adventure in building something that looks simple on the outside but hides a clever trick behind the curtain. It’s a way to learn how structure gives speed, and how a little brainpower saves a lot of time.

## Why C?

C is the language that lets you see the gears turning. It doesn’t babysit, it doesn’t clean up after you, and it doesn’t apologize. If you want to understand how things really work under the hood—memory, pointers, all the raw machinery—C hands you the wrench.

## Anything else?

This is a project for people who like peeking behind the scenes. It’s about understanding how everyday magic is built. If you’re curious enough to open the black box, welcome in.
